**2. The tentative project title**
Factors associated with response time of emergency medical service(EMS) in New York City


**3. The motivation for this project**
Longer response times affect survival rates. For time-sensitive conditions such as life-threatening emergency, a delay of even a few minutes can make the difference between life and death. Thus, analyzing the response time of EMS so as to improve it is important. 


**4. The intended final products**
Explain the response time with time of the day, weather, season, area and traffic, etc.  
we will analyze and visualize the effect of different factors on the resonse time in NYC. We wil also construct the website containing our analysis and graphs. 

**5. The anticipated data sources**

**(1) [Y, X1] Incidents Responded to by Fire Companies**
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Incidents-Responded-to-by-Fire-Companies/tm6d-hbzd

**(2) [X2] NYC weather data**
https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets

**(3) [X3] Street Closures due to construction activities by Intersection**
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Street-Closures-due-to-construction-activities-by-/478a-yykk


**6. The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges**
* Response time over a day 
  - during a day / during a night 
  
* Response time over a year 
  - by season link to weather data
  
* Response time vs traffic 
  - NYC has a lot of spots under construction.
  
  Street closure is related to ambulance response time.

**7. The planned timeline**

 
* __Nov12:__ Data cleaning and merging
* __Nov 20:__ Visualization
* __Nov 28:__ Assessment and Inferences
* __Dec 2:__ Final changes and finish report
* __Dec 5:__ Webpage and Screencast
